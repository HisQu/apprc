# Backlog

Treat this as the parking lot for actionable problems discovered while working but intentionally left unresolved.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is git-tracked: Never record secrets, absolute paths, credentials, private host data, or speculative security claims. Use only relative paths. 


> [!IMPORTANT]

> ## Rules
> 1) Do not remove or change this header and TOC without very good reason. 
> 1) Newest at the top.
> 1) Append a new entry only when the observation is real, actionable, not already listed, and out of scope for the current change. Do not modify `BACKLOG.md` when there is nothing useful to add.
> 1) If an issue is new and related to another issue, reference it in the `Suggested next step`. Do not create a new entry for the same problem. Place the reference in both entries (bi-directional).
> 1) If an issue was resolved, remove it and make an entry in the CHANGELOG.md.
> 1) **Types:**
>       - **Bug risk**: Potential defect with concrete evidence, not yet confirmed.
>       - **Code smell**: Implementation, architectural, maintainability or clarity issue that is not currently a defect.
>       - **Docs drift**: Documentation is stale, incomplete, or inconsistent.
>       - **Tooling**: Issue with build, test, lint, type-check, and general slowdown of developer workflow.
>       - **Security**: Evidence-backed security risk. Use Question for uncertainty.
>       - **Question**: Design, behavior, or ownership uncertainty needing investigation & maybe decision.
> 
> 1) **Priorities:**
>       - **P1**: Should be handled ASAP.
>       - **P2**: Should be handled before next release or milestone.
>       - **P3**: Useful cleanup for a later focused pass.
> 1) **Effort:**
>       - **E1**: Issue deserves its own focused pass.
>       - **E2**: Can be batched with a few other issues.
>       - **E3**: Can be batched with many other issues.
> 1) **Format:**

> - **Why not fixed now:** scope, risk, uncertainty, or user decision needed
> - **Evidence:** concrete observation
> - **Context:** explanation to ensure the problem is understood in the big-picture of the repo.

## P2 / E2 [Bug risk] - *Metadata-only version commands resolve appdata ownership*
- **Area:** `src/apprc/interfaces/cli/runtime.py`, `src/apprc/interfaces/cli/context.py`, and `src/apprc/user_files/installation/validation.py`.
- **Observed while:** Running an installed application's metadata-only `version` command with AppRC 0.34.0.
- **Why not fixed now:** The SDK release is already published. Changing CLI preparation needs a focused regression and an explicitly scoped maintenance change; existing application data must remain untouched.
- **Evidence:** The command raised `InstallationError: Nonempty native appdata container requires project-owned migration or adoption.` The same installed version query succeeded with an explicit fresh single-root layout.
- **Context:** CLI preparation resolves application paths before returning package metadata, so unrelated existing appdata can prevent a version query. The appdata ownership guard itself must remain strict.
- **Suggested next step:** Add an existing-suite CLI regression with an unknown appdata entry. Separate metadata-only command preparation from managed-path resolution without bypassing ownership checks for filesystem operations.

## P3 / E1 [Tooling] - *Windows and macOS installation validation is deferred*
- **Area:** `src/apprc/distribution/runtime`, `src/apprc/user_files/app_home/locations.py`, `src/apprc/interfaces/tui`, and their native tests.
- **Observed while:** Inspecting automatic [push CI run 42605623620](https://github.com/HisQu/apprc/actions/runs/42605623620) for `661738`.
- **Why not fixed now:** Explicitly deferred by the user. Keep CI Linux-only; native remediation is not a prerequisite for Linux releases or the current maintainability work.
- **Evidence:** Windows core/GUI and macOS core jobs failed while Ubuntu core Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 and Ubuntu GUI passed. Representative failures include Windows private staging ACL rejection, missing `ntsecuritycon` in standalone execution, macOS temporary-address link rejection, and native secret persistence/editor workflows.
- **Context:** The historical native failures remain unresolved; disabling their jobs did not fix them or establish compatibility. Their causes have not yet been separated into production defects, fixture/platform assumptions, interpreter prerequisites, newline expectations, or shell setup. Permission rejection alone is not evidence of a security vulnerability.
- **Suggested next step:** Leave the native jobs disabled while this work is deferred. Revisit when Windows/macOS validation is explicitly back in scope, starting with the recorded installation/ACL and standalone dependency failures, then path/interpreter and secret/UI workflows. Preserve containment and private-permission contracts; do not introduce runner, billing, or security changes implicitly.
